## Project Description

## Designing

## ER Model

### Entities

For our Entities-Relations Model, we consider all the below described entities as **strong**.

#### PATIENT

> Patients receive drug prescriptions by doctors.

Each patient is uniquely identified by a **PatientID** -- **PRIMARY KEY**:key:, and is characterized by the following **simple**, as well as **composite**, **attributes**:

- **Age**
- **FullName**
  - FirstName
  - LastName
- **Address**
  - Town
  - StreetName
  - Number
  - PostalCode

#### DOCTOR

> Doctors prescribe drugs and monitor patients.

Each doctor is uniquely identified by a **DoctorID** -- **PRIMARY KEY**:key:, and is characterized by the following **simple**, as well as **composite**, **attributes**:

- **Specialty**
- **ExperienceYears**
- **FullName**
  - FirstName
  - LastName

#### PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

> Pharmaceutical companies provide pharmacies with drugs.

Each pharmaceutical company is uniquely identified by a **PharmaceuticalCompanyId** -- **PRIMARY KEY**:key:, and is characterized by the following **simple** **attributes**:

- **Name**
- **PhoneNumber**

In addition, we consider that each pharmaceutical company has a unique name and a unique phone number, thus making the **Name** attribute a **Candidate Key** and the **PhoneNumber** a **Single-valued** (not **Multivalued**) attribute.

#### DRUG

> Drugs are produced by pharmaceutical companies.

Each drug is uniquely identified by a **DrugId** -- **PRIMARY KEY**:key:, and is characterized by the following **simple** **attributes**:

- **Name**
- **Formula**

Additionally, we consider as unique the commercial name of each drug, thus making the **Name** attribute a **Candidate Key**.

#### PHARMACY

> Prescriptions-R-X pharmacies.

Each pharmacy is uniquely identified by a **PharmacyID** -- **PRIMARY KEY**:key:, and is characterized by the following **simple**, as well as **composite**, **attributes**:

- **Name**
- **Address**
  - Town
  - StreetName
  - Number
  - PostalCode

Again, we considering as unique the name of each pharmacy, making the **Name** attribute a **Candidate Key**.

### Relations

#### SEEN BY

> Connects a patient with a corresponding doctor.

Each patient can be seen by **at most one** doctor, while each doctor can see **any number** patients.

Also, each patient has a doctor monitoring him, while a each doctor has **at least one** patient to monitor.

- Mapping Cardinality
  - **1:N**
- Total Participation
  - **DOCTOR**
  - **PATIENT**

#### SELL

> Connects a pharmacy with its selling drugs.

Each pharmacy can have for sale **any number** of drugs, while a drug can be
available at **any number** of pharmacies. Also, the relation holds a **Price**
attribute, representing the selling price of a drug.

Additionally, we consider that each pharmacy can have drugs for sale, while a drug can be **unavailable** at all pharmacies.

- Mapping Cardinality
  - **N:M**
- Total Participation
  - **Pharmacy**
- Partial Participation
  - **Drug**
- Relation Attributes
  - **Price**

#### MAKE

> Connects a drug with the pharmaceutical company producing it.

Each drug can be produced by **at most one** pharmaceutical company, while a
pharmaceutical company can be producing **any number** of drugs.

Additionally, each drug can be produced by a pharmaceutical company, while a pharmaceutical company might **not be producing** some drugs out of the totally registered ones.

- Mapping Cardinality
  - **1:N**
- Total Participation
  - **Drugs**
- Partial Participation
  - **Pharmaceutical Company**

#### PRESCRIPTION

> Connects a patient with a doctor and a prescribed drug.

This is a **ternary relationship**, where a patient can receive a prescription for
**any number** of drugs by **any number** of doctors, a doctor can prescribe
**any number** of drugs to **any number** of patients, and a drug can be
prescribed to **any number** of patients by **any number** of doctors. Also,
the relation holds a **Date** attribute, representing the prescription date,
and a **Quantity** attribute, representing the quantity of the prescribed
drug.

Additionally, for a patient might not exist a corresponding prescription, and a doctor might not have prescribed a prescription for a corresponding patient, while a drug might not have been prescribed by a doctor for a patient.

- Mapping Cardinality
  - **N:M:K**
- Partial Participation
  - **PATIENT**
  - **DRUG**
  - **DOCTOR**
- Relation Attributes
  - **Date**
  - **Quality**

Finally, if a doctor prescribes the same drug to the same patient, more than one time, then the **last** prescription is the one registered in our database.

#### CONTRACT

> Connects a pharmaceutical company with a pharmacy.

A pharmacy can be in contract with **any number** of pharmaceutical companies,
while a pharmaceutical company can be in contract with **any number** of
pharmacies. Also, the relations holds a **StartDate** and an **EndDate** attribute, representing the contract initialization and termination dates accordingly, a **Text** attribute, representing the text upon which the contract was agreed and signed by both counterparts, and a **Supervisor** attribute, representing the contract supervisor.

We consider that each pharmacy is in contract with a pharmaceutical company, to supply itself with drugs, while each registered pharmaceutical company is in contract with one of the pharmacies.

- Mapping Cardinality
  - **N:M**
- Total Participation
  - **PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY**
  - **PHARMACY**
- Relation Attributes
  - **StartDate**
  - **EndDate**
  - **Text**
  - **Supervisor**

Finally, if a pharmacy signs a contract with the same company, more than one time, then the last contract is the one registered in our database.

## R Model

Each strong entity is immediately converted to a relation.

Keys are noted in a **bold** & _tilted_ fashion.

Also, we replaced the composite attribute **Address** with the simple attributes composing it.

### Strong Entities to Relations

- **Patient** (**_PatientId_**, FirstName, LastName, Town, StreetName, Number, PostalCode, Age)
- **Doctor** (**_DoctorId_**, FirstName, LastName, Specialty, ExperienceYears)
- **PharmaceuticalCompany** (**_PharmaceuticalCompanyId_**, Name, PhoneNumber)
- **Drug** (**_Drug_**, Name, Formula)
- **Pharmacy** (**_PharmacyId_**, Name, Town, StreetName, Number, PostalCode, PhoneNumber)

### Relation Sets

- **SeenBy** (**_PatientId_**, DoctorId)
- **Sell** (**_PharmacyId_**, **_DrugId_**, Price)
- **Make** (**_DrugId_**, PharmaceuticalCompanyId)
- **Prescription** (**_PatientId_**, **_DoctorId_**, **_DrugId_**, Date, Quantity)
- **Contract** (**_PharmacyId_**, **_PharmaceuticalCompanyId_**, StartDate, EndDate, Text,
Supervisor)

## API

### SQL Structure

#### Table structure for 'patient'

```SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `patient` (

    `patient_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `name` varchar(20) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
    `surname` varchar(20) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
    `town` varchar(20) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
    `street_name` varchar(20) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
    `number` int(11) NOT NULL,
    `postalcode` int(11) NOT NULL,
    `age` int(2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`patient_id`)

) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=10;
```

#### Table structure for 'prescription'

```SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `prescription` (

    `patient_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
    `doctor_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
    `drug_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
    `date` date NOT NULL,
    `quantity` int(10) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`patient_id`, `doctor_id`, `drug_id`)

) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci;
```
